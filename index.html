    <p>My IP: 2001:4860:7:110e::64</p>

    <p>I was born and raised in Tanzania, but my upbringing stretched across the country.

        I first grew up in Kilimanjaro—yes, Kilimanjaro, you read that right. 
        The highest mountain in all of Africa was practically in my backyard :)
        Later, I moved to Arusha, a neighboring region, where I lived for two years.
        Afterwards, I relocated to Mwanza, in northern Tanzania. 
        Known for Lake Victoria—the largest lake in Africa—Mwanza was home 
        for three years. The lake is more than just water; 
        it's a source of life for the area: recreation, fishing, transportation, 
        and, most importantly, the origin of the Nile River, the longest river in Africa. 
        Mwanza was the best.

        Next, I moved to Morogoro in central Tanzania. It was the greenest place 
        I had ever seen besides Kilimanjaro. 
        Surrounded by the beautiful Uluguru mountain ranges, trekking was 
        always on my to-do list. Living there felt like being part of nature—it 
        was simply beautiful.

        After Morogoro, I moved to Dar es Salaam—the New York of Tanzania. 
        I admired how busy the city was. 
        It was rare to find a day without something happening. 
        At some point, I thought people never slept. But I liked it that way; 
        I naively believed I'd always have something to do.

        As of now, my GPS is still set in Dar es Salaam.

It's Mount Kilimanjaro! 
It is my pride; I aspire to climb it
again when I travel back home 
again!

    <p>Most of my friends don't know that I can ice-skate!</p>
